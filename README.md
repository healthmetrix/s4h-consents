# Smart4Health Consents

[![Build Status](https://drone.healthmetrix.com/api/badges/healthmetrix/s4h-consents/status.svg)](https://drone.healthmetrix.com/healthmetrix/s4h-consents)

Deployment of this repository as static assets takes place via netlify pointing to https://consents.smart4health.eu

The only active consent here is `research-consent-en` which will be accessible to dynamic-consent with the
consentId `smart4health-research-consent-en`.

`test-around-consent-en` is a playground, e.g. for applying some direct html rich-text stuff.
