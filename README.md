Smart4Health Consents

Deployment of this repository as static assets takes place via netlify pointing to https://consents.smart4health.eu

The only active consent here is `research-consent-en` which will be accessible to dynamic-consen with the
consentId `smart4health-research-consent-en`.

`test-around-consent-en` is a playground, e.g. for applying some direct html richtext stuff.
