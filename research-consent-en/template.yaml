  title: Smart4Health consent for research data provision
  image: /svgs/s4h.svg
  description: |
    Dear Smart4Health user, thank you for downloading and installing the Smart4Health research application.

    To use this application you need a Smart4Health account for the Smart4Health platform, where you collect
    your health data from different sources, such as medical records from your doctor’s office or step counts
    from your mobile phone.

    In the following, “we” refers to the researchers and developers of the EU-funded Smart4Health project under
    the scientific-technical coordination of Prof. Dr. Erwin Böttinger from the Hasso-Plattner-Institute (HPI).

information:
  - title: User information
    image: /svgs/information.svg
    summary: |
      Your health data can be valuable for medical research. Medical research is needed to improve the early
      detection, treatment, and prevention of diseases. Insights that are gained from using your health data
      may substantially contribute to these goals. To use your data means that researchers will access the data
      you share with the Smart4Health platform, combine it with data provided by other users, and analyze it to
      find answers to research questions. Use also entails that the results of these analyses are shared and
      discussed with other researchers and the public. Your health research data is not transmitted to third
      parties unless you give your consent to it, and it is never made public in a way that could identify you.

      This consent flow covers the provision of your health data for medical research purposes. This includes
      all research with the aim to improve health and wellbeing.

      If you do not want to provide your health data for medical research, do not sign this consent form.

      If you agree to provide your health data for medical research, your health data that you upload to the
      Smart4Health platform will be shared to a separate database called the Smart4Health research platform,
      controlled by the research institute Hasso-Plattner-Institute (HPI) and operated by the not-for-profit
      company data4life (D4L). HPI and D4L are partners in the EU-funded Smart4Health project, which you have
      already chosen to participate in. HPI is the scientific technical coordinator of the project and D4L is
      the data controller of the Smart4Health platform and its service.

      To provide your data for research is voluntary. If you do not wish to provide data for research, or
      wish to withdraw your consent later, it will not affect the medical care you receive or your ability to
      use the Smart4Health platform and its other services.

      Please read below for description about the Smart4Health research platform. If you do not fully agree with
      the nature and long-term duration of data use that we describe below, or if we have not answered your
      queries to your satisfaction, you should not give your consent.

  - title: What are our goals and the goal of medical research?
    image: /svgs/target.svg
    summary: |
      We want to establish a link between your health data and researchers, while keeping your identity safe.

      Medical research aims exclusively at improving the prevention, detection, and treatment of diseases. The
      goal of this research is neither to make a diagnosis for you nor to influence any medical care that you
      may currently be receiving – the goal of medical research is to affect medicine and healthcare on a
      broader scale.
    description: ""

  - title: How can you support this?
    image: /svgs/handshake-deal.svg
    summary: |
      You can choose to make your health data available for medical research.

      The health data you provide for research will be used in connection with health data provided by other
      Smart4Health users to answer various research questions related to medicine and healthcare.

      Your health data will not be used for research unrelated to the improvement of medicine and healthcare.
    description: ""

  - title: Why you cannot select the detailed research purpose?
    image: /svgs/checklist.svg
    summary: |
      Not all medical research purposes can be described at this stage, as we do not know what future medical
      research questions may arise; these can refer to whole areas of disease (e.g. cancer, cardiovascular diseases,
      brain diseases) as well as to specific diseases and changes in the genetic substance that are still partly
      unknown today. This means that your health data may be used for research questions that we cannot foresee today.
    description: ""

  - title: For how long is your consent valid and your data stored?
    image: /svgs/circular-clock-time.svg
    summary: |
      Your consent to the provision of health data is valid during the Smart4Health project, which will end on
      February 28, 2023.

      If you did not withdraw it, your consent to the processing and use of the collected data remains effective
      beyond this period for at least 30 years. You may proceed to provide your health data after the end of the
      project by signing a re-consent form.
    description: |
      If you do not withdraw it beforehand, your consent to the provision of health data is valid during the
      Smart4Health project, which will end on February 28, 2023. We will remind you by November 30, 2022 at the
      latest that the project is going to be completed. After the project has ended, if we do not hear from you by
      June 30, 2023, we will assume that you have not withdrawn your consent.

      Your health data will be stored for 30 years from the time of your consent if you have not withdrawn your
      consent beforehand. In special cases, data may also be important to science beyond this 30-year point. In
      these cases, HPI as the data controller during and after the project would consult with the relevant data
      protection authorities and an independent ethics committee to determine whether further use of your data
      is possible.

  - title: What is Health data?
    image: /svgs/folder-data-storage.svg
    summary: |
      Health data is all information related to your personal health. This includes, but is not limited to,
      patient data from your electronic health records and citizen-generated fitness data.
    description: |
      Citizen-generated fitness and health data include data from sensors, wearables and/or fitness apps (e.g.,
      the heart rate data tracked by a smartwatch).

      Patient data is all information about you that is recorded and/or used during a medical examination and
      treatment, and is stored in any of your electronic health records that come from previously visited health
      professionals or hospitals.

  - title: What kind of  data will you provide?
    image: /svgs/data-storage.svg
    summary: |
      Certain data elements must be included in order for health data to be useful in research. If you consent to
      providing data for medical research purposes, you will provide patient summaries, and medication plans to the
      research platform (as far as available).
    description: |
      The data elements you must include in your provision to research, if available, are

      1. The patient summary, which is a standardized set of basic medical data that includes the most important
      clinical facts required to ensure safe and secure healthcare. Though this data is mainly intended to aid
      health professionals in providing unscheduled care, it can also be used to provide planned medical care
      (e.g. in the case of citizen movements or cross-organizational care paths) . This includes alerts (allergies,
      intolerances), medical history (vaccinations, problems, surgeries), medication summary (current medicines),
      medical problems (diagnoses, implants), physical findings (vital signs), and diagnostic tests (blood group)

      2. The medication plan, which includes also the medication history (doses and dates of prescribed medicines)

  - title: What kind of data will you provide?
    image: /svgs/data-storage.svg
    summary: |
      You can also provide additional optional health data, depending on your personal preferences.

      This data may include, but are not limited to, laboratory results, and self-generated fitness data.
    description: ""

  - title: What is coding?
    image: /svgs/mask.svg
    summary: |
      Information that can easily be used to identify you personally is replaced by a combination of characters.
      (e.g. John Doe → 18Jh47&6G)
    description: |
      When collecting health data, information such as your name and date of birth is also collected. Such
      information can easily be used to identify you personally. This information is replaced by a combination of
      characters. In this way, it is more difficult to trace back to your person. You will only be traced back if your
      health data is to be supplemented with additional information about you or if we want to contact you again
      (see point 2 below).

      Data that identify you will never be disclosed to anybody, in particular not to insurance companies or employers,
      except in cases permitted by you or regulated by law.

  - title: What happens, when you provide your health data?
    image: /svgs/process.svg
    summary: |
      You sign the consent and select which data from your collection on the Smart4Health platform you want to provide.
      Data identifying you is replaced by an internal code. This internal code is stored within your encrypted personal
      Smart4Health account and can only be accessed by you. After the data is coded, it is transferred to the
      Smart4Health research platform and stored there.
    description: |
      You need to be signed in to your Smart4Health account (1). Right after you sign the consent (2), you will be
      able to select which data from your collection on the Smart4Health platform you want to provide (3). Some data
      elements must be provided, as explained before.

      From the selected data, all data directly identifying you (name, date of birth, address, etc.) will be replaced
      (4) by a combination of characters (“coding”, as explained before). Once this internal code
      replaces your identifying information (5), your associated health data can then no longer be connected directly
      to your person.

      This internal code is stored within your encrypted personal Smart4Health account and can only be accessed by you.
      The connection of this internal code to the data directly identifying you can only be triggered by you. With this,
      the health data provided for medical research cannot be traced back to you, or only with disproportionate
      technical effort, if you do not actively allow it.

      After the data is coded, it is transferred to the Smart4Health research platform and stored there (6). At the end,
      you will receive a notification of the success of the data provision.

  - title: How can you provide additional data to research?
    image: /svgs/plus.svg
    summary: |
      Whenever you have new personal health data stored in your Smart4Health platform you can also provide this data
      for research using the Smart4Health research application by repeating steps 3 to 6 explained in the last
      screen. Alternatively, you can decide to allow the automatic provision of future data using the Smart4Health
      research application.
    description: |
      Automatic provision of future data applies to the required health data and, if you want, optional health data
      according to your preferences. Whenever such health data is uploaded to your Smart4Health account, it will be
      automatically processed to be provided to research. This means the application will perform the provision
      automatically in the background and you will receive a notification of the successful provision as a push-message
      or email according to your preferences.

  - title: How is your health data used for science?
    image: /svgs/how-is-used.svg
    summary: |
      To “use” your data means that researchers will access your data, combine it with data provided by other users,
      and process it all together to find answers to research questions. Use also entails that the results of these
      analysis are shared and discussed with other researchers. Your health research data is not transmitted to third
      parties without your consent.

      Researchers from universities, research institutions and researching companies can request access to your health
      data for medical research purposes. Each individual research project that requests to use your health data is
      reviewed in advance by a Data Access Committee and requires the committee’s approval before the project may
      begin. The researchers may not pass on the access to the data or the data itself and they must not use it for
      other purposes.

      Data Access Committee

      The Data Access Committee (DAC) is a body constituted of named individuals from the Smart4Health consortium
      whom are responsible for data release to external requestors (researchers) based on your consent and National
      Research Ethics terms.

      Your health data will be used exclusively for scientific purposes; it will not be sold. However, Smart4Health
      may collect a fee from the respective researchers.

      In the Smart4Health research application and at https://smart4health.eu/studies you can see at any time which
      studies are carried out with your data or the data of other users. In addition to this, you can register for a
      mailing list, which will inform you about all new studies by e-mail or through the Smart4Health research
      application at least one week before data is being used.

      The data used for scientific publications of results is exclusively anonymous, i.e. in a form that does not
      allow any conclusions about or links to your identity.

      Anonymization

      During anonymization, your data will be changed in such a way that it can no longer be connected to your identity,
      or only with a disproportionate technical effort. Any unique link to your identity will be completely removed.
    description: "" # TBD

  - title: Under which circumstances does your health data leave the Smart4Health research platform?
    image: /svgs/exit.svg
    summary: |
      You can choose whether or not your data may be send from the Smart4Health research platform to other research
      groups outside of Smart4Health. The data is anonymised before it leaves the research platform. Once the data
      has left the research platform, this cannot be undone if you withdraw your consent after this happened.
    description: |
      The receiving research groups and their databases may be located in countries of the European Union (EU) or in
      countries where the EU has determined adequate data protection measures are in place. Your data will not be send
      to other countries that do not have an acceptable level of data protection. The responsibility and supervision
      of the data lies with the receiving institution, which ensures equal data security and compliance measures as is
      established by Smart4Health.

  - title: What are the risks associated with using your health data?
    image: /svgs/warning.svg
    summary: |
      Whenever data is provided to a researcher, there is a risk of loss of private information. This risk always
      exists, but there are procedures in place to minimize the risk. The data stored in our research platform is
      separated from your name and other personal identifiers.
    description: |
      If your private information was misused, it is possible you would experience other harms, such as stress,
      anxiety, stigmatization, or embarrassment from revealing information about your family relationships, ethnic
      background, or health conditions. Examples for misuse of private information are, e.g. to take actions on your
      behalf or to blackmail you with disclosed information.

      The unique code linking your data to your identity is stored separately and securely within your encrypted ;
      personal Smart4Health account and can only be accessed by you.

  - title: What are the benefits for you personally?
    image: /svgs/charity-tree.svg
    summary: |
      There is no expected direct benefit or advantage to your health from providing your data for medical research.
      Your consent and provision of data for research will not have consequences for any medical treatment you may be
      receiving. Furthermore, if a commercial benefit is derived from the research, e.g. through the development of
      new drugs or diagnostic procedures, you will have no rights in the results and will not receive a share in
      the profits.
    description: ""

  - title: What benefits are there for our society?
    image: /svgs/charity-help.svg
    summary: |
      Medical-scientific research projects aim at improving our understanding how diseases develop over time and how
      we can improve disease prevention, treatment, and care. For more information about the research activities based
      on the data in the Smart4Health research platform, please visit our website.

    description: |
      You can see your contribution to research at any time using the Smart4Health research application. This means
      for example that you can check in how many studies your data was used so far. To find a complete list of
      functions and features of the application, please visit our website.

  - title: Will we be re-contacting you?
    image: /svgs/recontacting.svg
    summary: |
      In order to obtain additional information from you, it may be useful to contact you again at a
      later point in time.

      Even when re-contacting you, researchers never know your identity. The re-contacting request by researchers
      needs the approval of the Data Access Committee.

      You may decline being re-contacted in the declaration of consent (“right not to know”).
    description: |
      The re-contacting can be done

      - To inform you about new research projects/studies and scientific results, which are related to your provided data,

      - To obtain additional information related to scientific questions we are investigating. Additional information
        would only be obtained from you with your consent.

      You can retrieve any requests using the Smart4Health Research Application. There is no other way to contact you.

  - title: What does your right of withdrawal include?
    image: /svgs/stop-violence.svg
    summary: |
      To provide data for research is voluntary. You can withdraw your consent to provide health data for research at
      any time, without consequences to you. You can do this in whole by revoking the consent, or in part by changing
      individual statements of your consent.
    description: |
      The withdrawal only refers to the future use of your health data. Data cannot be removed from analyses that have
      already been carried out, or if anonymized data has been transmitted to third parties. It cannot be removed
      because there is no way of tracing the anonymous data back to you.

      If you choose to withdraw your consent to the research platform, your health data that has been stored based on
      this consent will be anonymized, if law permits this, by erasing the identification code that has been assigned
      to you. Your anonymized data is not used for any future research, but remains accessible for completed and
      ongoing research projects to ensure reproducibility of research results. However, as we explained in the Risk
      section (see point 1.6), anonymization of your health data can never completely rule out the possibility of
      re-identification by drawing on other data sources.

      If anonymisation is not possible or not permitted by law, your provided health data will be deleted.

      You can also change individual parts of the declaration of consent without withdrawing it in whole. For example,
      you can change your consent preferences if you wish to continue to make the health data available to research but
      no longer have interest in being contacted for study participation.

      For withdrawal, please use the withdraw function in the Smart4Health research application or contact:
